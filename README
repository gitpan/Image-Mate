- THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS MODULE WHATSOEVER -

Image::Mate provides a simple interface for creating and manipulating 
graphics utilizing whatever graphics modules are available to Perl. 
The graphics modules it'll attempt to utilize are Imager, GD and 
Image::Magick in that order. You can set the order of preference.

This module is ideal for people (like myself) who produce scripts that can 
end up on all different kinds of servers across the internet. You can never 
guarantee what modules will be available (or which the hosts will be willing 
to install).

This is the first release and distinctly lacking in features :(
Although I'll be adding new features as time goes on :)
Hopefully others will also add new functions as well :D
